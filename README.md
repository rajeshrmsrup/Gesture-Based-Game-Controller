# Gesture-Based-Game-Controller
A tool to control video games using hand gestures

I built this tool using some of latest, cutting edge ,amazing libraries of Python like OpenCV, mediapipe and ctype.
OpenCV - deals with video capturing, display, text display over video part.
Mediapipe- deals with recognizing hand gestures.
Ctype- uses scan codes for pressing the key according to a particular gesture.
