# Gesture-Based-Game-Controller
A tool to control video games using hand gestures.
This tool can play games like Hill Climb Racing games, racing, and some of the action games. Instead of using a keyboard and mouse, you can upgrade to the Gesture based game controller, You can control your character's movement by just moving your hands around in view of your camera, and use different hand gestures and hand movements to perform different actions in the game.

## How I built it?
I built this tool using some of latest, cutting edge ,amazing libraries of Python like OpenCV, mediapipe and ctype.
### OpenCV
OpenCV deals with video capturing, display, text display over video part.
### Mediapipe
Mediapipe deals with recognizing hand gestures.
### Ctype 
Ctype uses scan codes for pressing the key according to a particular gesture.
